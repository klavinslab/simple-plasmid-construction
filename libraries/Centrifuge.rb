# This module is made to cover all common cases of directing the tech to
# centrifuge, decant, and resuspend multiple batches of tubes.
# centrifuge_resuspend_cycle is the public method of this module.
# It allows staggered centrifuging so that the tech can be resuspending
# the previous batch while the next batch is centrifuging.
